# Scripts for Crash by BC Originals

Automated strategy management for BC Originals Crash Game.

## 2x Chasing
This strategy hinges on the concept of waiting for a series of ‘red’ games—where the multiplier falls below a certain threshold—before initiating bets.

## 10x Chasing
This script empowers betters to chase a 10x payout methodically.

## Bouncy 3x
This progressive betting strategy actively increases the bet amount after each loss by summing the previous two bets. It continues this pattern until achieving a win at 3x, after which it resets the betting sequence. The strategy includes a waiting period based on consecutive games without reaching a 3x multiplier. It also features a safety mechanism in the form of a maximum bet limit.

## Calculated Cascade
The strategy focuses on waiting for a series of games without hitting a specific multiplier (e.g., 10x) before placing a bet. Once the threshold of games without the multiplier is reached, you start betting with a base amount. The bet amount and strategy may vary depending on whether you choose to multiply or add to their bet after each loss.

## Growing payout
The strategy focuses on adjusting the payout target based on the outcomes of previous games.
